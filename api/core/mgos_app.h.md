# App

This file contains definitions for the user-defined app entry point,
`mgos_app_init()`.

The `mgos_app_init()` function is like the `main()` function in the C
program. This is a app's entry point.

The mongoose-os core code does implement `mgos_app_init()`
stub function as a weak symbol, so if user app does not define its own
`mgos_app_init()`, a default stub will be used. That's what most of the
JavaScript based apps do - they do not contain C code at all.

Usage example:
```c
#include "mgos_app.h"

enum mgos_app_init_result mgos_app_init(void) {
  if (!my_super_duper_hardware_init()) {
    LOG(LL_ERROR, ("something went bad"));
    return MGOS_APP_INIT_ERROR;
  }
  LOG(LL_INFO, ("my app initialised"));
  return MGOS_APP_INIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

### C/ะก++ API
#### mgos_app_init

```c
enum mgos_app_init_result mgos_app_init(void);
```

User app init function.
A weak stub is provided in `mgos_app_init.c`, which can be overridden.
 
#### mgos_app_preinit

```c
void mgos_app_preinit(void);
```

An early init hook, for apps that want to take control early
in the init process. How early? very, very early. If the platform
uses RTOS, it is not running yet. Dynamic memory allocation is not
safe. Networking is not running. The only safe thing to do is to
communicate to mg_app_init something via global variables or shut
down the processor and go (back) to sleep.
