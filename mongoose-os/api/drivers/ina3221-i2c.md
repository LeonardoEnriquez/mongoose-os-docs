A Mongoose library for Texas Instruments' 3-channel current sensor.

## Implementation details

The `INA3221` is a simple I2C device that measures current through shunt
resistors on three separate channels. It is able to measure the voltage
on each channel (max 26V, in 8mV increments) and the voltage drop over the
shunt resistor in 40uV increments with a range of 163.8mV, and is quite
precise.

Using a 0.1Ohm shunt resistor, the maximum current that can be measured
is 1.638A. Each channel can be enabled/disabled and polled individually.

## API Description

Create an `INA3221` object using `mgos_ina3221_create()`, set the shunt
resistor values for each channel using `mgos_ina3221_set_shunt_resistance()`,
then call `mgos_ina3221_get_bus_voltage()` to get the bus voltage,
call `mgos_ina3221_get_shunt_voltage()` to get the voltage drop over
the shunt resistor, and `mgos_ina3221_get_current()` to get the current
flowing through the channel.

Valid channels are `1`, `2` or `3` (ie. they are 1-based).

## Example application

```
#include "mgos.h"
#include "mgos_config.h"
#include "mgos_ina3221.h"

static void ina3221_timer_cb(void *user_data) {
  struct mgos_ina3221 *sensor = (struct mgos_ina3221 *)user_data;

  if (!sensor) return;

  for (uint8_t i=1; i<4; i++) {
    float bus, shunt, current, res;
    mgos_ina3221_get_bus_voltage(sensor, i, &bus);
    mgos_ina3221_get_shunt_resistance(sensor, i, &res);
    mgos_ina3221_get_shunt_voltage(sensor, i, &shunt);
    mgos_ina3221_get_current(sensor, i, &current);
    LOG(LL_INFO, ("Chan[%u]: Vbus=%.3f V Vshunt=%.0f uV Rshunt=%.3f Ohm Ishunt=%.1f mA",
      i, bus, shunt*1e6, res, current*1e3));
  }
}

enum mgos_app_init_result mgos_app_init(void) {
  struct mgos_ina3221 *sensor;

  sensor = mgos_ina3221_create(mgos_i2c_get_global(), mgos_sys_config_get_ina3221_i2caddr());
  if (!sensor) {
    LOG(LL_ERROR, ("Could not create INA3221 sensor"));
    return false;
  }

  mgos_set_timer(1000, true, ina3221_timer_cb, sensor);

  return MGOS_APP_INIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

#### mgos_ina3221_create

```c
struct mgos_ina3221 *mgos_ina3221_create(struct mgos_i2c *i2c, uint8_t i2caddr);
```
> 
> Initialize a INA3221 on the I2C bus `i2c` at address specified in `i2caddr`
> parameter (default INA3221 is on address 0x40). The sensor will be polled for
> validity, upon success a new `struct mgos_ina3221` is allocated and
> returned. If the device could not be found, NULL is returned.
>  
#### mgos_ina3221_destroy

```c
void mgos_ina3221_destroy(struct mgos_ina3221 **sensor);
```
> 
> Destroy the data structure associated with a INA3221 device. The reference
> to the pointer of the `struct mgos_ina3221` has to be provided, and upon
> successful destruction, its associated memory will be freed and the pointer
> set to NULL.

#### mgos_ina3221_get_bus_voltage

```c
bool mgos_ina3221_get_bus_voltage(struct mgos_ina3221 *sensor, uint8_t chan, float *volts);
```
>  Measure the bus voltage on channel `chan` (which can be 1, 2, or 3). Return the
> measured voltage in `*volts`, in units of Volts.
> Returns true on success and false on failure, in which case `*volts` is unspecified.

#### mgos_ina3221_get_shunt_voltage

```c

#### mgos_ina3221_set_shunt_resistance

```c
bool mgos_ina3221_set_shunt_resistance(struct mgos_ina3221 *sensor, uint8_t chan, float ohms);
```
>  Set the shunt resistor value in units of Ohms on channel `chan` (which can be 1, 2 or 3).
> Typical values is ohms=0.100 (which yields a 1.6A range on the current sensor).
> Returns true on success and false on failure.

#### mgos_ina3221_get_shunt_resistance

```c
bool mgos_ina3221_get_shunt_resistance(struct mgos_ina3221 *sensor, uint8_t chan, float *ohms);
