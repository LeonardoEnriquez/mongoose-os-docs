# Licensing and Contact

mDash is distributed by Mongoose OS team as a standalone docker image that
could be run on-premises, as well as a hosted service https://dash.mongoose-os.com.

In order to run mDash on-premises, install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and
execute `docker run mgos/dash`. Customisation
can be done via the configuration. By default, there is a restriction on the
maximum number of users (5 maximum), with maximum of 2 devices per user.

Please [contact us](https://mongoose-os.com/contact.html) if you would like
to use the mDash in your production setup with increased limits.
