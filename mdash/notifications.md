# Notifications

The dashboard provides a special secure Websocket endpoint
`wss://dash.mongoose-os.com/api/v2/notify`. This is a read-only notifications endpoint.
Each notification is a JSON object with three keys:

- `name`: notification name, e.g. "online", "offline", "rpc.in.GetInfo", "rpc.out.Log"
- `id`: an ID of a device that generated the event
- `data`: optional notification-specific data.

The `online` and `offline` events are generated by the dashboard. The
`rpc.out.*` events are generated by the device: these are JSON-RPC requests
without an ID (notifications). For example, `dash` library forwards all
device logs to the dashboard as `Log` RPC calls, thus generating `rpc.out.Log` events.
RPC call to the device generate `rpc.in.*` events.

The dashboard UI uses `/api/v2/notify` endpoint in order to catch state changes.
Login to the dashboard and open the developer tools / network / WS panel to
see it in action.

You can implement your own service that attaches to the `/api/v2/notify`,
for example in Node JS:

```javascript
const Websocket = require('ws');
const addr = 'wss://dash.mongoose-os.com/api/v2/notify?access_token=API_TOKEN';
const ws = new Websocket(addr, { origin: addr });
ws.on('message', msg => console.log('Got message:', msg.toString()));
```
